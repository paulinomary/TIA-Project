# Heart Attack Prediction Project Using AI

This project was developed by a group of students of the Department of Informatics Engineering of the Univeristy of Coimbra for the Artificial Intelligence Topics' Course of the first semester of the academic year of 2021/2022.

This project uses Python Libraries and applies methods to a dataset and study its' reaction to tests and understand what is the best method and the biggest accuracy that can be achieved when studying heart attacks with this specific dataset.

### Python Libraries:
- Scikit Learn (sklearn)
- Pandas (pd)
- MatPlotLib (plt)
- Seaborn (sns)
- TensorFlow

Beginning with sklearn, it was used for almost every model such as K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF).
Pandas is also a very important library to read and analyse the dataset and it's one of the biggest bases of many projects since it allows to import and read the information of the most various file type.
MatPlotLib and Seaborn are useful to visualize data and put it into plots to compare and to take conclusions out of them. Lastly, TensorFlow helped a lot when building the Artificial Neural Network (NN) which was the last model implemented and for that there was a need to use Keras.
